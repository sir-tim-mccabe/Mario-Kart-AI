# Mario Kart AI

This is a reupload of the original project from 2017.

Use snes9x-rr v1.51 (https://github.com/TASVideos/snes9x-rr) with a ROM of Super Mario Kart for the SNES and a completed save file. Launch the Python script, then select a 150cc game as Koopa Kid in the game. Once you see the Python script output "Ready to start network 0 of generation 1", launch the Lua script while "Mushroom Cup" is highlighted.

Once you have a saved pool, you can change the "load_saved_pool" flag in the Python script to 1 to continue where you left off.
